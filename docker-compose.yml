services:
  # This service runs the postgres DB used by dagster for run storage, schedule storage,
  # and event log storage. Depending on the hardware you run this Compose on, you may be able
  # to reduce the interval and timeout in the healthcheck to speed up your `docker-compose up` times.

      # This service runs the gRPC server that loads your user code, in both dagster-webserver
      # and dagster-daemon. By setting DAGSTER_CURRENT_IMAGE to its own image, we tell the
      # run launcher to use this same image when launching runs in a new container as well.
      # Multiple containers like this can be deployed separately - each just needs to run on
      # its own port, and have its own entry in the workspace.yaml file that's loaded by the
      # webserver.
